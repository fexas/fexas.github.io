Supervisor: Prof. [Lei Ge](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/jszy/fea3723225674f648224755a1b247658.htm)

Mar. 2023 --- Jun. 2023, RUC

- [Github Repositories](https://github.com/fexas/StockProject)

In this project, I implemented machine learning model (including OLS ,Lasso, RF, XGboost, Lgbm, NN3), to forecast stock reutrns and identify potential market trends.
